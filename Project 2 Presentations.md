# Project 2 Presentation Guide

## Presentation should be 10-15 minutes

There should be:
- A powerpoint
- A demo of the application
- Everyone should speak, try to split it evenly

## Presentation should consist of

1. Introduction, tell us about yourself/team
    - Work on handing off
2. Explain the project
3. Talk about the technology you used
4. Talk about your team organization structure
5. Mention features, and how they were developed
6. Talk about any testing you did
7. Talk about any future implementations
8. Mention things you learned
9. Mention challenges, and how you solved them
10. Asking for questions should be last

Most importantly have fun with the presentation, use your creativity but keep it professional. Keep in mind this is not a super strict guideline, and you can rearange some of the points, but this is meant as a dry run for your project 3 presenatations where I will expect all of these boxes to be checked.
